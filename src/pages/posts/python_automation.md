Python made my fingers orgasm! I've always wanted to try coding with Python and now I got the motivation to do some python project. "Automation", sounds cool right?! Nah Machine Learning and AI right now is way cooler and in trend. Anyways!

## Section 1

I'm a .NET guy but I wanted to add more arsenals on my backend programming, Python was my next target, I wanted to make some automation tasks for softwares. So I decided to Learn Python by doing the **PROJECT**

Yes! you heard it right, I find myself that I learn fast by immediately applying what I've watched in crash course, or read some documentations, crazy! So I had decided to Automate some work in my current job. I love how this is going.
